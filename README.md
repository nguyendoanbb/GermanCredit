## German Credit Analysis

A main objective of this project is predicting whether a loan will be of a good or bad risk based on all features included in our dataset. A comparison between three models (Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Random Forest) are also included. We use accuracy as our metric for this predictive modeling. However, we also want to minimize predicting people of bad risk with good risk in order to minimize loss of money. 

This project also explores the behavior of German borrowers. We will use visualization such as bar chart and box plot to find any hidden patterns in features of borrowers with good and bad risks.
